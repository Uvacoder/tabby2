# Tabby the Copycat Privacy Policy
The Tabby the Copycat Safari Extension does not collect any data, period. No browsing history. No button clicks. Nothing in the app sends any message outside your computer. Using the extension is entirely private. You can even view the source code at https://github.com/wingovers/Tabby.

What you do in Safari is no one else’s business but yours.
